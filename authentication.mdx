### Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `API-KEY` header of your requests:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ledgerbeam.com/v1/transactions \
  -H "API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"description": "APPLE.COM/BILL"}'
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Keep your API key secure** - Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories
- **Use environment variables** - Store your API key in secure environment variables
- **Rotate keys regularly** - Generate new keys periodically for enhanced security
- **Monitor usage** - Check your dashboard regularly for unusual activity

## Rate Limits

Account creation is free. But paid plans include higher limits and priority processing. Check your current plan in the [dashboard](https://app.ledgerbeam.com/settings/billing).
