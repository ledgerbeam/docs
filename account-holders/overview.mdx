Account holders represent individuals or businesses whose financial transactions are processed and analyzed through Ledgerbeam. The account holder system provides a foundation for organizing transactions, applying custom categorization rules, and generating personalized insights based on spending patterns and financial behavior.

## What Are Account Holders?

Account holders are entities that own or control financial accounts and whose transactions are being processed through Ledgerbeam. They can be individual consumers managing personal accounts like individual checking, savings, and credit card accounts, handling personal finance management including budgeting, expense tracking, and financial planning, understanding personal spending patterns and habits, and tracking recurring payments and subscriptions.

Business entities include small businesses like sole proprietorships, partnerships, and small companies, corporate accounts with large business accounts and complex transaction patterns, multi-account management for businesses with multiple bank accounts and credit cards, and financial reporting for generating business financial reports and analytics.

## Account Holder Benefits

### Enhanced Transaction Processing

When transactions are associated with account holders, Ledgerbeam can provide more accurate and personalized analysis. Improved categorization includes context-aware categorization where categories are assigned based on account holder type like consumer vs. business, custom category sets that allow account holders to have their own custom categorization rules, historical learning where the system learns from past transactions to improve future categorization, and business-specific categories that give business account holders accounting-appropriate categories.

Personalized insights include spending pattern analysis to understand individual or business spending habits, budget tracking to monitor spending against budgets and financial goals, trend analysis to identify spending trends and seasonal patterns, and anomaly detection to flag unusual transactions or spending patterns.

### Recurrence Detection

Account holders enable more sophisticated recurrence detection through pattern recognition that detects personal recurring payments and subscriptions, identifies business recurring expenses and income, finds patterns across multiple accounts for the same holder, and understands timing patterns specific to each account holder.

Recurring group management includes subscription tracking to manage all subscriptions for an individual or business, expense forecasting to predict future recurring expenses, payment optimization to identify opportunities to optimize recurring payments, and contract management to track contract renewals and payment schedules.

## Account Holder Types

### Consumer Account Holders

Consumer account holders are individuals managing personal finances with characteristics including personal spending for individual consumer purchases and expenses, consumer categories focused on personal spending like Food & Dining and Entertainment, subscription management for personal subscriptions and recurring services, and budget tracking for personal budgeting and financial goal tracking.

Use cases include personal finance apps for building personal finance management applications, expense tracking for individual expense tracking and categorization, subscription management for managing personal subscriptions and recurring payments, and financial planning for personal financial planning and goal setting.

### Business Account Holders

Business account holders represent companies and organizations with characteristics including business expenses for corporate spending and operational expenses, accounting categories aligned with accounting standards, multi-account management for managing multiple business accounts, and financial reporting for generating business financial reports.

Use cases include business finance apps for building business financial management applications, expense management for corporate expense tracking and reimbursement, financial reporting for generating business financial reports and analytics, and cash flow management for business cash flow analysis and forecasting.

## Account Holder Management

### Creating Account Holders

Account holders are created through our API with required information including a unique identifier for the account holder, type specification as either "consumer" or "business", and an optional name for the account holder. Optional information includes custom categorization rules for this account holder and additional metadata about the account holder.

### Transaction Association

Transactions can be associated with account holders through direct association by including account holder ID when enriching transactions, automatic assignment based on account information, and manual assignment after processing. Bulk assignment includes batch processing to assign multiple transactions to account holders in bulk, pattern-based assignment to automatically assign transactions based on patterns, and rule-based assignment using rules to automatically assign transactions.

### Data Organization

Account holders provide a foundation for organizing financial data through transaction grouping by account holder, by specific accounts within account holders, by spending categories, and by time periods like monthly or quarterly. Analytics and reporting include individual reports for specific account holders, comparative analysis to compare spending patterns across account holders, trend analysis to analyze trends within and across account holders, and forecasting to predict future spending and income patterns.

## Privacy and Security

### Data Protection

Account holder data is protected with enterprise-grade security through encryption of all data in transit and at rest, role-based access controls for account holder data, complete audit trail of all account holder operations, and configurable data retention policies.

Privacy compliance includes full compliance with European data protection regulations through GDPR compliance, California Consumer Privacy Act compliance, SOC 2 Type II compliance for security and availability, and data minimization that only collects and processes necessary data.

### Data Ownership

Account holders maintain full control over their data through data export to export all account holder data at any time, data deletion to delete account holder data and all associated transactions, data modification to update and modify account holder information, and access management to control who has access to account holder data.
