Conversational analytics lets you interact with your data using natural language. Instead of writing SQL queries or building dashboards, you can simply ask questions and receive intelligent, context-aware answers.

## How It Works

When you send a message to Ledgerbeam, our AI-powered system processes your natural language query through several sophisticated steps:

### Understanding Your Query

Our AI analyzes your question to understand intent, identifies the data you're asking about, recognizes context from previous messages in the conversation, and determines the best approach to answer your question.

### Query Generation

The system automatically generates optimized SQL queries based on your data schema, validates queries before execution to ensure safety and accuracy, handles complex joins and aggregations automatically, and optimizes for performance and efficiency.

### Data Execution

Queries are executed against your connected data sources securely, results are processed and validated for accuracy, and the system handles errors gracefully with helpful error messages.

### Intelligent Response

Results are formatted in the most appropriate way—tables for structured data, charts for trends, summaries for insights—and presented with context and explanations to help you understand the answer.

## Conversation Threads

Each conversation is organized into threads, allowing you to maintain context across multiple questions. Threads remember previous queries and answers, enabling natural, flowing discussions about your data.

### Thread Management

- **Create new threads** - Start a fresh conversation about a new topic
- **Continue existing threads** - Build on previous questions and answers
- **Archive threads** - Keep your workspace organized
- **Delete threads** - Remove conversations you no longer need

## Streaming Responses

For real-time interactions, you can enable streaming responses. This provides immediate feedback as the AI processes your query, showing thinking steps, query generation, and results as they become available.

## Supported Data Sources

Ledgerbeam connects to a wide variety of data sources:

- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Supabase
- **Spreadsheets**: Google Sheets
- **Business Tools**: Stripe, Airtable, and more
