Get started with Ledgerbeam's conversational analytics in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through connecting a data source and making your first query.

## Prerequisites

- A Ledgerbeam account ([sign up here](https://app.ledgerbeam.com))
- An API key (see [Authentication](./authentication))
- A data source to connect (database, spreadsheet, etc.)

## Step 1: Connect Your Data Source

First, you'll need to connect a data source. This could be a database, spreadsheet, or other business tool.

### Connect a Database

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ledgerbeam.com/v1/resources \
  -H "API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Database",
    "type": "postgres",
    "uri": "postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database"
  }'
```

### Connect Google Sheets

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ledgerbeam.com/v1/resources \
  -H "API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Sales Data",
    "type": "google_sheets",
    "uri": "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SHEET_ID"
  }'
```

## Step 2: Make Your First Query

Once your data source is connected, you can start asking questions:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ledgerbeam.com/v1/chats/messages \
  -H "API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resource_id": "your_resource_id",
    "content": "What are my top 10 customers by revenue this month?"
  }'
```

## Step 3: Continue the Conversation

You can continue asking follow-up questions in the same thread:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ledgerbeam.com/v1/chats/messages \
  -H "API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resource_id": "your_resource_id",
    "thread_id": "thread_id_from_previous_response",
    "content": "Show me a breakdown by region"
  }'
```

## Step 4: Enable Streaming (Optional)

For real-time responses, enable streaming:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ledgerbeam.com/v1/chats/messages \
  -H "API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resource_id": "your_resource_id",
    "content": "What are my sales trends?",
    "stream": true
  }'
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "user_message": {
    "id": "msg_123",
    "content": "What are my top customers?",
    "role": "user"
  },
  "assistant_message": {
    "id": "msg_124",
    "content": "Here are your top customers by revenue...",
    "role": "assistant"
  },
  "meta": {
    "answer": "Your top customers are...",
    "metrics": {
      "row_count": 10,
      "query_time": "0.45s",
      "query": "SELECT ..."
    }
  },
  "thread_id": "thread_abc123"
}
```
