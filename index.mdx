Ledgerbeam is a conversational analytics platform that lets you talk to your data using natural language. Connect your databases, spreadsheets, and business tools, then ask questions in plain English to get instant, expert-level answers with beautiful visualizations and insights.

Stop building dashboards. Start talking to your data.

## Conversational Analytics

Ledgerbeam transforms how teams interact with their data. Instead of writing SQL queries or building complex dashboards, you can simply ask questions in natural language and receive instant, intelligent responses. Our AI-powered platform understands your data structure, generates optimized queries, and presents results in clear, actionable formats.

## Key Features

### Natural Language Queries

Ask questions in plain English and get instant answers. No SQL knowledge required. Our AI understands context, learns from your data structure, and generates accurate queries automatically.

### Universal Data Connections

Connect to any database, spreadsheet, or business tool. We support PostgreSQL, MySQL, Supabase, Google Sheets, Stripe, Airtable, and many more. Your data stays secure and accessible.

### Intelligent Responses

Get more than just raw data. Our AI provides context-aware answers, suggests follow-up questions, and presents results in tables, charts, and visualizations that make insights immediately actionable.

### Conversation Threads

Maintain context across multiple questions. Each conversation thread remembers previous queries, allowing for natural, flowing discussions about your data.
