Connect an authenticated GraphQL API to Ledgerbeam to query your GraphQL data using natural language. This is for GraphQL APIs that require custom authentication.

## Features

- Full GraphQL support with authentication
- Custom authentication methods
- Automatic schema introspection
- Query and mutation support

## Connection Requirements

- A GraphQL API endpoint
- Authentication credentials (API key, token, etc.)
- Network access to the GraphQL endpoint

## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to Resources in your Ledgerbeam dashboard
2. Click "Add Resource" and select "Authenticated GraphQL API"
3. Enter your GraphQL configuration:
   - **Endpoint URL**: Your GraphQL endpoint (e.g., `https://api.example.com/graphql`)
   - **Authentication**: Configure your authentication method
     - API Key (header or query parameter)
     - Bearer Token
     - Basic Auth
     - Custom headers
4. Provide authentication credentials
5. Ledgerbeam will introspect your GraphQL schema
6. Test the connection
7. Click "Create Resource" to complete setup

## Authentication Methods

### API Key
- Add API key as a header (e.g., `X-API-Key`) or query parameter
- Specify the header/parameter name and value

### Bearer Token
- Provide your bearer token
- Automatically added as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### Basic Auth
- Provide username and password
- Automatically encoded and added to Authorization header

### Custom Headers
- Add any custom headers required by your API
- Useful for custom authentication schemes

## Schema Introspection

Ledgerbeam automatically:
- Introspects your GraphQL schema
- Understands types, queries, and mutations
- Identifies relationships and nested structures
- Makes your GraphQL data queryable

## Querying Authenticated GraphQL APIs

You can query your GraphQL data using natural language:

- "What are all the users?"
- "Show me the latest posts"
- "What's the total count of orders?"

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Verify your GraphQL endpoint URL is correct
- Check that the endpoint is accessible
- Ensure authentication credentials are correct
- Verify network connectivity

### Authentication Issues

- Check that your API key or token is valid
- Verify authentication method matches your API requirements
- Ensure credentials haven't expired
- Check header names and formats

### Schema Issues

- Check that GraphQL introspection is enabled
- Verify your schema is valid
- Ensure you have permissions to introspect
- Verify authentication allows schema access

## Best Practices

- Use HTTPS for secure connections
- Keep API credentials secure and encrypted
- Enable GraphQL introspection for better results
- Regularly rotate authentication tokens
- Document your schema for reference
