Connect your Redis instance to Ledgerbeam to query your cached data using natural language. Redis is an in-memory data structure store.

## Features

- Full Redis integration
- Support for keys, strings, hashes, lists, and sets
- Automatic data structure detection
- Real-time data access

## Connection Requirements

- A Redis server (version 5.0 or higher)
- Network access to your Redis server
- Authentication password (if required)

## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to Resources in your Ledgerbeam dashboard
2. Click "Add Resource" and select "Redis"
3. Enter your Redis configuration:
   - **Host**: Your Redis host (e.g., `redis.example.com`)
   - **Port**: Redis port (default: 6379)
   - **Password**: Redis password (if required)
   - **Database**: Redis database number (default: 0)
4. Click "Test Connection" to verify
5. Click "Create Resource" to complete setup

## Data Structures

Ledgerbeam supports querying:
- **Strings**: Simple key-value pairs
- **Hashes**: Field-value maps
- **Lists**: Ordered collections
- **Sets**: Unordered collections
- **Sorted Sets**: Ordered collections with scores

## Querying Redis Data

You can query your Redis data using natural language:

- "What keys exist in Redis?"
- "Show me the value of a specific key"
- "What's the size of a hash or list?"

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Verify your Redis server is accessible
- Check firewall rules allow connections on port 6379
- Ensure authentication password is correct
- Verify Redis is running

### Permission Issues

- Check that your Redis user has read permissions
- Verify database number is correct
- Ensure keys are accessible

## Best Practices

- Use read-only mode for production
- Enable SSL/TLS for secure connections (if supported)
- Regularly monitor Redis performance
- Keep authentication credentials secure
