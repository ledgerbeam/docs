Connect your Elasticsearch cluster to Ledgerbeam to query your search and analytics data using natural language. Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine.

## Features

- Full Elasticsearch integration
- Support for indices and documents
- Query DSL understanding
- Automatic index analysis

## Connection Requirements

- An Elasticsearch cluster (version 7.0 or higher)
- Network access to your Elasticsearch cluster
- Authentication credentials (if required)

## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to Resources in your Ledgerbeam dashboard
2. Click "Add Resource" and select "Elasticsearch"
3. Enter your Elasticsearch configuration:
   - **Host**: Your Elasticsearch host (e.g., `https://elasticsearch.example.com`)
   - **Port**: Elasticsearch port (default: 9200)
   - **Authentication**: If required, provide credentials
4. Click "Test Connection" to verify
5. Click "Create Resource" to complete setup

## Schema Analysis

After connecting, Ledgerbeam automatically:
- Analyzes your Elasticsearch indices
- Understands document mappings
- Identifies field types and structures
- Makes your Elasticsearch data queryable

## Querying Elasticsearch

You can query your Elasticsearch data using natural language:

- "What are the most recent documents in the logs index?"
- "Show me documents matching a specific pattern"
- "What's the total count of documents?"

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Verify your Elasticsearch cluster is accessible
- Check firewall rules allow connections
- Ensure authentication credentials are correct
- Verify cluster health

### Index Issues

- Check that indices exist and are accessible
- Verify index mappings are correct
- Ensure you have read permissions

## Best Practices

- Use read-only users for production
- Enable SSL/TLS for secure connections
- Regularly resync your resource to pick up changes
- Monitor cluster health
