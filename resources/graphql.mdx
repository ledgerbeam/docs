## Schema Introspection

Ledgerbeam automatically:
- Introspects your GraphQL schema
- Understands types, queries, and mutations
- Identifies relationships and nested structures
- Makes your GraphQL data queryable

## Querying GraphQL APIs

You can query your GraphQL data using natural language:

- "What are all the users?"
- "Show me the latest posts"
- "What's the total count of orders?"

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Verify your GraphQL endpoint URL is correct
- Check that the endpoint is accessible
- Ensure authentication credentials are correct
- Verify network connectivity

### Schema Issues

- Check that GraphQL introspection is enabled
- Verify your schema is valid
- Ensure you have permissions to introspect

## Best Practices

- Use HTTPS for secure connections
- Keep API credentials secure
- Enable GraphQL introspection for better results
- Document your schema for reference
