Connect your MongoDB database to Ledgerbeam to query your document data using natural language. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database.

## Features

- Full MongoDB support
- Automatic collection analysis
- Document structure understanding
- Support for MongoDB Atlas and self-hosted instances

## Connection Requirements

- MongoDB server version 4.0 or higher
- Network access to your MongoDB server
- Database credentials (if authentication is enabled)
- Database name you want to connect to

## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to Resources in your Ledgerbeam dashboard
2. Click "Add Resource" and select "MongoDB"
3. Enter your connection details:
   - **Connection URI**: Your MongoDB connection string
     - Format: `mongodb://[username:password@]host[:port][/database][?options]`
     - For MongoDB Atlas: `mongodb+srv://[username:password@]cluster.mongodb.net/database`
   - **Database name**: The database you want to connect to
4. Click "Test Connection" to verify
5. Click "Create Resource" to complete setup

## MongoDB Atlas Connection

For MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted):

1. Get your connection string from MongoDB Atlas:
   - Go to your cluster in MongoDB Atlas
   - Click "Connect"
   - Choose "Connect your application"
   - Copy the connection string
2. Replace `<password>` with your database password
3. Enter the connection string in Ledgerbeam
4. Test and create the resource

## Schema Analysis

After connecting, Ledgerbeam automatically:
- Analyzes your MongoDB collections
- Understands document structure and fields
- Identifies data types and nested structures
- Makes your document data queryable

## Querying MongoDB

You can query your MongoDB data using natural language:

- "What are the most recent orders?"
- "Show me users with the highest activity"
- "What's the average order value by category?"

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Verify your MongoDB server is accessible
- Check firewall rules allow connections
- Ensure your credentials are correct
- Verify the database name exists
- For Atlas, check IP whitelist settings

### Authentication Issues

- Verify username and password are correct
- Check authentication database if different from target database
- Ensure user has read permissions

## Best Practices

- Use read-only database users for production
- Enable SSL/TLS for secure connections
- Regularly resync your resource to pick up schema changes
- Monitor connection health in your dashboard
