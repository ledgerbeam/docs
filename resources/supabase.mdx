Connect your Supabase project to Ledgerbeam to query your data using natural language. Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative built on PostgreSQL.

## Features

- Full Supabase PostgreSQL support
- Simple URI-based connection
- Automatic schema analysis
- Secure connection handling

## Connection Requirements

- An active Supabase project
- Your Supabase database connection URI
- Network access to your Supabase instance

## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to Resources in your Ledgerbeam dashboard
2. Click "Add Resource" and select "Supabase"
3. Get your Supabase connection URI:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings > Database
   - Copy your connection string (URI format)
4. Enter the URI in Ledgerbeam:
   - Format: `postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres`
   - Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your database password
   - Replace `[PROJECT-REF]` with your project reference
5. Click "Test Connection" to verify
6. Click "Create Resource" to complete setup

## Finding Your Connection URI

Your Supabase connection URI can be found in:
- **Supabase Dashboard**: Settings > Database > Connection string
- **Connection Pooling**: Settings > Database > Connection pooling (for connection pooling)

## Security

- Passwords are encrypted before storage
- Connections use SSL/TLS by default
- Credentials are never exposed in API responses

## Schema Analysis

After connecting, Ledgerbeam automatically:
- Analyzes your Supabase database schema
- Identifies tables, columns, and relationships
- Understands Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Makes your data queryable with natural language

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Verify your Supabase project is active
- Check that your database password is correct
- Ensure your project reference is correct in the URI
- Verify network connectivity to Supabase

### URI Format Issues

- Ensure the URI follows the correct format
- Check for special characters in passwords (may need URL encoding)
- Verify the project reference matches your Supabase project

## Best Practices

- Use connection pooling URIs for better performance
- Keep your database password secure
- Regularly resync your resource to pick up schema changes
- Monitor connection health in your dashboard
