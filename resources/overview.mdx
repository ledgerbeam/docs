Resources are your connected data sources in Ledgerbeam. They represent databases, spreadsheets, APIs, and other business tools that you want to query using natural language.

## What Are Resources?

A resource is a connection to a data source that Ledgerbeam can query. When you create a resource, Ledgerbeam analyzes the data structure, understands the schema, and makes it available for conversational queries.

## Supported Resource Types

### Databases

Connect to relational databases to query structured data:

- **[PostgreSQL](/resources/postgresql)** - Full support for PostgreSQL databases
- **[MySQL](/resources/mysql)** - Connect to MySQL and MariaDB databases
- **[Supabase](/resources/supabase)** - Connect to Supabase projects
- **[MongoDB](/resources/mongodb)** - Connect to MongoDB databases
- **[Oracle](/resources/oracle)** - Connect to Oracle databases

### Spreadsheets

Query spreadsheet data directly:

- **[Google Sheets](/resources/google-sheets)** - Connect to Google Sheets spreadsheets

### Business Tools

Integrate with popular business applications:

- **[Stripe](/resources/stripe)** - Query payment and subscription data
- **[Airtable](/resources/airtable)** - Connect to Airtable bases
- **[Intercom](/resources/intercom)** - Connect to Intercom for customer data

### APIs

Connect to REST and GraphQL APIs:

- **[REST API](/resources/rest-api)** - Connect to any REST API
- **[GraphQL](/resources/graphql)** - Connect to GraphQL APIs
- **[Authenticated GraphQL](/resources/authenticated-graphql)** - Connect to authenticated GraphQL endpoints

### Search & Caching

Connect to search engines and caching systems:

- **[Elasticsearch](/resources/elasticsearch)** - Connect to Elasticsearch clusters
- **[Redis](/resources/redis)** - Connect to Redis instances

### Google Services

Integrate with Google Workspace:

- **[Google Calendar](/resources/google-calendar)** - Connect to Google Calendar
- **[Google Drive](/resources/google-drive)** - Connect to Google Drive

## Resource Lifecycle

### Creating Resources

When you create a resource, Ledgerbeam:

1. Validates the connection credentials
2. Analyzes the data structure and schema
3. Identifies tables, columns, and relationships
4. Makes the resource available for queries

### Schema Analysis

Ledgerbeam automatically analyzes your data structure to understand:

- Tables and their relationships
- Column names, types, and constraints
- Primary and foreign keys
- Data patterns and sample values

### Resyncing Resources

If your data structure changes, you can resync a resource to update Ledgerbeam's understanding of your schema.

## Security

### Credential Management

- Credentials are encrypted and stored securely
- Passwords are never exposed in API responses
- Connections use encrypted protocols (SSL/TLS)

### Access Control

- Resources are scoped to your organization
- Only authorized team members can access resources
- API keys control access to resources

## Container Management

Resources contain containers (tables, sheets, etc.) that hold your data. You can:

- List all containers in a resource
- Get detailed information about specific containers
- Update container metadata and descriptions
- Manage fields within containers

## Field Configuration

For each field in your containers, you can:

- Set semantic types (e.g., "email", "currency", "date")
- Configure possible values for categorical data
- Add descriptions to help the AI understand your data better
