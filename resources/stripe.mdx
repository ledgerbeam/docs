Connect your Stripe account to Ledgerbeam to query payment, subscription, and customer data using natural language. Stripe is a popular payment processing platform.

## Features

- Full Stripe API integration
- Access to payments, customers, subscriptions, and more
- Real-time data synchronization
- Secure API key management

## Connection Requirements

- An active Stripe account
- Stripe API keys (Secret key)
- Network access to Stripe API

## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to Resources in your Ledgerbeam dashboard
2. Click "Add Resource" and select "Stripe"
3. Get your Stripe API key:
   - Go to your Stripe Dashboard
   - Navigate to Developers > API keys
   - Copy your Secret key (starts with `sk_`)
4. Enter your Stripe Secret key in Ledgerbeam
5. Click "Test Connection" to verify
6. Click "Create Resource" to complete setup

## API Keys

Stripe provides two types of API keys:
- **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_`): Not used for Ledgerbeam
- **Secret key** (starts with `sk_`): Required for Ledgerbeam connection

Use your **Secret key** for the connection. Keep it secure and never expose it publicly.

## Available Data

Once connected, you can query:
- Payments and charges
- Customers and customer data
- Subscriptions and plans
- Invoices and billing
- Products and prices
- Events and webhooks

## Querying Stripe Data

You can query your Stripe data using natural language:

- "What are my total revenue this month?"
- "Show me customers with the highest lifetime value"
- "What subscriptions are expiring this week?"

## Security

- API keys are encrypted before storage
- Connections use HTTPS
- Credentials are never exposed in API responses
- Use test mode keys for development

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Verify your Stripe API key is correct
- Check that the key is active and not revoked
- Ensure you're using the Secret key (not Publishable)
- Verify network connectivity to Stripe API

### Permission Issues

- Check that your API key has the necessary permissions
- Verify your Stripe account is active
- Ensure you have access to the data you're querying

## Best Practices

- Use test mode keys for development and testing
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Monitor API usage in your Stripe dashboard
- Use webhooks for real-time updates (separate from resource connection)
