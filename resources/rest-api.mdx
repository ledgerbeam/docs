## Features

- Connect to any REST API
- Custom authentication support
- Flexible endpoint configuration
- Automatic response parsing

## Connection Requirements

- A REST API endpoint
- API authentication credentials (if required)
- Network access to the API

## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to Resources in your Ledgerbeam dashboard
2. Click "Add Resource" and select "REST API"
3. Enter your API configuration:
   - **Base URL**: Your API's base URL (e.g., `https://api.example.com`)
   - **Authentication**: Choose authentication method
     - API Key
     - Bearer Token
     - Basic Auth
     - Custom headers
4. Configure authentication details
5. Test the connection
6. Click "Create Resource" to complete setup

## Authentication Methods

### API Key
- Add API key as a header or query parameter
- Specify header name (e.g., `X-API-Key`)

### Bearer Token
- Provide your bearer token
- Automatically added as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### Basic Auth
- Provide username and password
- Automatically encoded and added to Authorization header

### Custom Headers
- Add any custom headers required by your API

## Querying REST APIs

Ledgerbeam will:
- Make appropriate HTTP requests to your API
- Parse JSON responses
- Understand response structure
- Make data queryable with natural language

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Verify your API base URL is correct
- Check that the API is accessible
- Ensure authentication credentials are correct
- Verify network connectivity

### Response Issues

- Check that your API returns JSON
- Verify response structure is consistent
- Ensure error responses are handled properly

## Best Practices

- Use HTTPS for secure connections
- Keep API credentials secure
- Test your API endpoints before connecting
- Document your API structure for better query results
