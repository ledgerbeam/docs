Welcome to the Ledgerbeam API Reference. Our RESTful API provides programmatic access to conversational analytics, allowing you to query your data using natural language, manage resources, and interact with your data sources.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:
```
https://api.ledgerbeam.com/v1
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your API key. Include it in the `API-KEY` header:

```bash
API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY
```

See our [Authentication guide](../authentication) for details on obtaining and using your API key.

## Request Format

All requests should include the following headers:
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY`

## Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format with the following structure:

### Success Response
```json
{
    // Response data here
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "error": {
    "field_name": [
      "Error message here"
    ]
  }
}
```

Or for general errors:
```json
{
  "error": "Error message here"
}
```

## Rate Limits

- **Free Plan**: 1,000 requests per minute
- **Pro Plan**: 10,000 requests per minute
- **Enterprise Plan**: Custom limits

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `400` - Bad Request (invalid parameters)
- `401` - Unauthorized (invalid API key)
- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Not Found
- `429` - Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded)
- `500` - Internal Server Error

See our [Error Handling guide](../errors) for detailed error information.
