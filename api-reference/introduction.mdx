### Base URL

All API requests should be made to:
```
https://api.ledgerbeam.com/v1

### Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your API key. Include it in the `API-KEY` header:

```bash
API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Request Format

All requests should include the following headers:
- `Content-Type: application/json`

### Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format with the following structure:

#### Success Response
```json
{
    // Response data here
}
```

#### Error Response
```json

  "error": {
    "description": [
